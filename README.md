- [hoot-api-links](https://github.com/chrisashwalker/hoot-api-links)

## API Gateway
- [hoot-api-gateway](https://github.com/chrisashwalker/hoot-api-gateway)

## Run
- Clone the microservice repositories
- Build Docker images as per instructions for each repository
- Clone the API gateway repository
- Pull the Docker image for RabbitMQ, with:
```
docker pull rabbitmq:3-management-alpine
```
- Run instances of the microservices and the API gateway using the Docker Compose configuration in this repository, with the command:
```
docker compose up -d
```

## Next steps for development
- Set up RabbitMQ for messaging, including: 
  - Queuing requests upon failure to connect to APIs
  - Send notifications upon completion of pending requests
  - Update links database upon deletion of people, posts or teams
- Set up databases
- Build frontend
